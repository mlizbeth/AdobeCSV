# AdobeCSV
I have decided to discontinue the java version of this program, but it will remain here for those that wish to learn or need examples. Please use the python release and feel free to modify these programs to meet your needs.

# Usage
The python script expects the following mandatory flags

`-i` or `--input` to specify the path of the file you want to read from. e.g., ~/Desktop/in.csv

`-o` or `--output` to speciy the path of the file you want to write to (this will create it if it doesn't exist) e.g., ~/Desktop/out.csv

`-m` or `--mode` to specify the operation mode. `1` is designated for Faculty/Staff and `2` for Students.
